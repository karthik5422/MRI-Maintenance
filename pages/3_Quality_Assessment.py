Consider 'Geometric accuracy (mm)' allowed range is +/-1 and 0, 'High-contrast spatial resolution (mm)' allowed range is 1, 'Slice thickness accuracy (mm)' allowed range should be less than 1, 'Slice position accuracy (mm)' allowed range is +/-1 and 0, 'Image intensity Uniformity (%)' allowed range is greater than or equal to 90%, 'Percent signal ghosting (%)' should be less than 1, 'Low-contrast object detectability (contrast level)' allowed range is greater than 7
Based on data given above, analyze result data of each test with above given allowed ranges and share the output of each test in given format.
'Name' should be Test Name,
'Observations' can be analyzed the result data of each test with respective Test allowed ranges and provide count of fails and count of success with comma separated and show mandatory the '% success rate' and highlight '% success rate' in bold letters.
'Actions' based on observation with result data of each test with respective Test allowed ranges, identify the faults and improvements, suggest precise actions in professional way to avoid downtime of MRI system and provide summary within 20 words,
'Components' specify which MRI component is required maintenance; and highlight the component name in Bold letters. If there is no component is required, display "Not applicable" in bold letters,
'Urgency (Approx.)' as "Immediate", "7 days", "30 days", "90 days" of time
'Impact' specify the important of components mentioned above for MRI machine and denotes as "Low", "Moderate", "Medium", "High", "Critical" .
The output should use the below labels; Output should not be crossed 4000 tokens.
Name:
Observations:
Actions: 
Components:
Urgency (Approx.):
Impact: 
The output should be shown in table format by using above columns""")
